This is the first of hopefully many logs to mark the development of Tanaki and Lingonberry Intelligence. Considering putting this into a public git repository and ingesting it into Tanaki's RAG knowledgebase with some automation. I'll do it by hand right now.

I'm getting settled into Australia after 15 years being primarily based in the United States. I'm going full Jeff Bezos (without the creepy billionare clown laugh) and setting up a space in my parent's basement. It will be the Lingonberry Intelligence Lab / Safe House. I'd like to setup a few nodes for the Andromeda.computer setup CJ has been building. It currently supplies the voice models for Tanaki over Geppetto.app's API.

Jonbo helped me get the tanaki.ai website live. The Tanaki on there is not the smartest yet, but I hope these logs and a shared knowledge base across all the instances of Tanaki will help improve the experience meaningfully. 

I believe the most interesting contributions to AI personalities and characters will be made by non technical people. We will need experiences to allow them to imbue and transmute their energy into virtual intelligences that feel natural.
