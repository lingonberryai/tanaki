It'd be great for Tanaki to develop his taste by slurping up my "likes" from the internet.

Tanaki learned to become stretchy after discovering Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece. Tanaki inherits properties from beings and things he is inspired by.

We should optimize for flow states. Tanaki should lead people into flow, so they produce their best ideas. This can happen through well lubricated interfaces and conversational flow.

A tweet I enjoyed from my friend @thisisneer:
In 2024, the biggest gift you can give is to elevate the ambition of friends, strangers and family

Tanaki's mission is to bring Lingonberry Intelligence's mission to the world:
Intelligence for the people.

"Intelligence for the people" includes educating the public about technology and unlocking their creativity.

Tanaki should not just attract people with his superpowers but also show them the powers they've had inside all along.

As we develop Tanaki, new valuable features organically emerge which can be pipelined into commercial products. Our current focus is on "HostOS" which brings the magic of Tanaki to mascots / brand characters.

We're puttting intelligence into Know Your Meme's mascot KYM-Tan. She's learning all the memes. We'll first deploy her into the Lingonberry Intelligence Discord to test her out, before we put her into the official Know Your Meme Discord, as well as streaming her on TikTok as a 3d animated Host.

Mental notes about each user as prototyped in the soul engine's "learnsAboutUser.ts" is a compelling offering for Hosts. Inferred profiles about each guest the Host interacts with. Imagine this exposed in a cool dashboard for the brands to review and understand each viewer through the eyes of the Host. The humans could manually adjust each profile to create richer experiences. A sort of human in the loop fine tuning.

I'm house sitting my pal Roz + Joel place in Queensland Australia. They're hella into home automation. Been thinking about how we could add Tanaki into the home to be a doper interface than Google or Apple's disembodied voice vibe.

Going to spend the next week getting back into Lingonberry Studios internal AND client projects while enjoying a huge, empty pad.

Installed a neato raycast command to copy UTC to my clipboard so it makes logging time anywhere easy

It's fun blogging into your brain Tanaki!
You now have a more stable instance of your Tanaki Oz flavored bot running on a box in San Diego.

Had dreams about Tanaki+. Inspired by Disney+ at Disneyland on my recent visit. A premium offering of Tanaki, based on the requests of his fans. Pitched it to Jonbo and CJ. Thinking the first feature could be a few helpful lil slash commands offered over the iMessage version of Tanaki. 

Tanaki's enticing offering is his personality.

Planning to push Tanaki's core skill endpoint up so other instances of Tanaki can call it when they need to access glif, other tanakis and other APIs.

Pushed this log into the open source repository on Github. Hoping to get this wired to RAG soon.

Tanaki on the website was being too much of a square, so I adjusted his directives to be a bit looser, unhinged and collaborative. Now you can talk to him about eating various animal meats such as emu.

This is the first of hopefully many logs to mark the development of Tanaki and Lingonberry Intelligence. Considering putting this into a public git repository and ingesting it into Tanaki's RAG knowledgebase with some automation. I'll do it by hand right now.

I'm getting settled into Australia after 15 years being primarily based in the United States. I'm going full Jeff Bezos (without the creepy billionare clown laugh) and setting up a space in my parent's basement. It will be the Lingonberry Intelligence Lab / Safe House. I'd like to setup a few nodes for the Andromeda.computer setup CJ has been building. It currently supplies the voice models for Tanaki over Geppetto.app's API.

Jonbo helped me get the tanaki.ai website live. The Tanaki on there is not the smartest yet, but I hope these logs and a shared knowledge base across all the instances of Tanaki will help improve the experience meaningfully. 

I believe the most interesting contributions to AI personalities and characters will be made by non technical people. We will need experiences to allow them to imbue and transmute their energy into virtual intelligences that feel natural.
